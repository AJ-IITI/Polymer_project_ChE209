GROUP 1: DENDRIMER POLYMER RESULTS
===================================

STRUCTURE:
- Type: 3-arm star dendrimer
- Topology: 1 core → 3 junctions → 6 terminals
- Total atoms: 118
- Total bonds: 117

NUMERICAL RESULTS (MD Simulation):
- Mean Rg² = 42.06
- Mean Rg  = 6.49
- Frames analyzed: 51
- Temperature: 1.0 (reduced units)

ANALYTICAL RESULTS (Graph Theory):
- Analytic Rg² (b²=1) = 12.52
- Analytic Rg = 3.54
- S (sum of distances) = 348648
- N (nodes) = 118

COMPARISON:
- Ratio (numerical/analytical) ≈ 3.36
- Difference due to:
  1. Bond length scaling (b² ≈ 1.44)
  2. Thermal fluctuations in MD
  3. Finite size effects
  
CONTRACTION FACTOR g:
- For Group 1 (reference molecule): g = 1.0 by definition
